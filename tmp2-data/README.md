## ./tmp2-data/

These data and associated figures are 4 hour ahead predictions, but only 4 hours. This doesn't seem like a perfect comparison between 4 hour and 48 hour tasks, so I will perform another run where the simulation predicts 4 hours ahead for a total of 48 hours.

These simulations are using the infinity norm.

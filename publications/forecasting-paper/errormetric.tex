\subsection{Performance Metrics}
We measure the accuracy of the model using two error metrics:
mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).
These are defined as
\begin{align}
  \text{MAE} &= \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\left|y_i - \hat{y}_i\right|\\
  \text{RMSE} &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\left(y_i - \hat{y}_i\right)^2}
  \intertext{where}
  \hat{y_i} & \text{ is the predicted output}\nonumber\\
  y_i & \text{ is the true value}\nonumber
\end{align}
The MAE measures the expected error throughout the forecast horizon. The RMSE
indicates the presence of large but infrequent errors. Since the data were
normalized by system capacity \cite{wang_quantifying_2016}, the error metrics
are easily interpretable.
In order to compare how each individual weather input either improved or
worsened the forecast we calculated a ``percent improvement'' over the
univariate case (i.e. a demand prediction based only on historical demand data).
This percent improvement is calculated by
\begin{align}
  \text{\% Improvement} &= \frac{\hat{e} - e}{e}\times 100, \text{ [-]}
\end{align}
where $e$ is the error from the univariate forecast and $\hat{e}$ is the  error
from the duovariate forecast. The sign indicates the direction of change in
error. Finally, in order to facilitate comparison with other work, we calculated
the normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) by
\begin{align}
  NRMSE &= \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\left(y_i - \hat{y}_i\right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(y_i - \tilde{y_i}\right)^2}}
  \intertext{where}
  \tilde{y} & \text{ is the mean of the target set}\nonumber
\end{align}

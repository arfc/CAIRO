\subsection{Performance Metrics}
We measure the accuracy of the model using two error metrics:
mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).
These are defined as
\begin{align}
  \text{MAE} &= \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\left|y_i - \hat{y}_i\right|\\
  \text{RMSE} &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N\left(y_i - \hat{y}_i\right)^2}
\end{align}
The MAE measures the expected error throughout the forecast horizon. The RMSE
indicates the presence of large but infrequent errors. Since the data were
normalized by system capacity \cite{wang_quantifying_2016}, the error metrics
are easily interpretable.

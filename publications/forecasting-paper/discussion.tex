\section{Discussion}

The forecast accuracy of our \gls{esn} for the Lorenz model does not persist
for quite as long as in other works \cite{pathak_using_2017}. However, our
model does replicate the environment that produces the Lorenz Attractor.
Further, optimal parameters may be unique for each randomly instantiated
reservoir. It is impossible to replicate the exact conditions of other works
without information about a seed for the random state. We have included this information for future work to compare with our results.

For each target variable, demand, wind, or solar, we found that air pressure was
the only meteorological factor that improved the forecast error in every case.
Solar elevation angle also decreased the error in every case with one exception,
48-hour ahead solar production. One possible reason for the improved performance
from adding air pressure is that the data may contain implicit information about
weather dynamics. For example, air pressure typically changes throughout the
day due to solar heating and has close relationship to air temperature
\cite{aguilar_seasonal_2001}, thus
it contains implicit information about both the amount of solar energy reaching
the ground and the ambient temperature which influences electricity demand.
Similarly, the height of the sun in the sky has a strong influence on
ambient weather and thus on  demand and the production of renewable energy.
Elevation angle lacks information about how much solar energy reaches the
ground, which is perhaps why air pressure performed better in some cases.
Using the solar angle to improve forecasting has a couple of important
advantages over measured weather data. First, it can be calculated accurately
within a minute time-resolution \cite{us_department_of_commerce_esrl_nodate}.
Second, because solar angle can be calculated deterministically, it reduces the
amount of data processing required.

The forecast lengths were decided based on the requirements for improved
economics and planning mentioned in the literature
 \cite{wang_quantifying_2016,mc_garrigle_quantifying_2015,brancucci_martinez-anido_value_2016}.

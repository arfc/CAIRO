We repeated the 4-hour and 48-hour ahead forecasts for solar energy production
on the \gls{uiuc} campus. Figure \ref{fig:solar48} and Figure \ref{fig:solar04}
show the best forecasts for 48-hours ahead and 4-hours ahead, respectively. The
shaded gray regions emphasize periods when   the predicted energy production dipped
below zero. This should never occur in reality. Table \ref{tab:solar48} shows
that relative humidity was the best additional feature for the 48-hour ahead
prediction, while Table \ref{tab:solar04} shows that wet bulb temperature
improved the forecast the most. In both cases, the predictions were improved
by each feature, except for air pressure and wind speed.

Our results are comparable to other work that used \glspl{esn} to forecast
solar energy \cite{li_echo_2019}.
However, these results show that conventional \glspl{esn} are insufficient for
improving energy economics through day-ahead forecasting
\cite{brancucci_martinez-anido_value_2016}.

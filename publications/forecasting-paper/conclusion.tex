\section{Conclusion}

Improving renewable energy forecasting is important for grid-planning
and unit commitment, especially as the share of variable renewable resources
increases, challenging grid stability. We first
demonstrated that our implementation of the \gls{esn} algorithm is consistent
with the literature. Then, we used it to predict
total demand, solar energy, and wind energy. Finally, we evaluated the
influence of several meteorological factors on prediction accuracy. Our results 
show that researchers must carefully choose each additional training input to
avoid increasing the system complexity. Our results also indicate that properly
chosen training inputs can achieve comparable accuracy to more complex
algorithms. The conventional \gls{esn} used here did not demonstrate an
improvement over the state-of-the-art, nor was it accurate enough to improve
grid-scale energy economy. Future work will explore other applications of
\glspl{esn} and pursue improvements to the model algorithm.

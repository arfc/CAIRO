\section{Conclusion}

Improving renewable energy forecasting is important for grid-planning
and unit commitment. Especially as the share of variable renewable resources
increases, challenging the baseload power from nuclear plants. We first
demonstrated that our implementation of the \gls{esn} algorithm is consistent
with the literature. Then we applied this model to prediction tasks for
total demand, solar energy, and wind energy, and evaluated the influence of
several meteorological factors on model performance. Our results show that only
air pressure and solar angle were consistently good at improving model accuracy.
However, the conventional \gls{esn} used here did not demonstrate a significant
improvement over the state-of-the-art. Nor was it accurate enough to improve
grid-scale energy economy. Future work will explore other applications of \glspl{esn} and evaluate improvements to the model algorithm.

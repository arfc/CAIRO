\section{Conclusion}

Improving renewable energy forecasting is important for grid-planning
and unit commitment, especially as the share of variable renewable resources
increases, challenging the baseload power from nuclear plants. We first
demonstrated that our implementation of the \gls{esn} algorithm is consistent
with the literature. Then, we used this model to predict
total demand, solar energy, and wind energy, and evaluated the influence of
several meteorological factors on model performance. Our results show that
researchers must carefully choose each additional input to avoid increasing the
system complexity.
The conventional \gls{esn} used here did not demonstrate an
improvement over the state-of-the-art, nor was it accurate enough to improve
grid-scale energy economy. Future work will explore other applications of
\glspl{esn} and evaluate improvements to the model algorithm.

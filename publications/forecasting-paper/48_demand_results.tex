We used \glspl{esn} to forecast electricity demand, or electric load, at both
4-hour intervals and 48-hour intervals. Figure \ref{fig:48demand} shows the
48-hour ahead forecast that had the lowest RMSE. In this case, the forecast
that used relative humidity as an additional input had the lowest error, as
shown in Table \ref{tab:demand48}. Table \ref{tab:demand48} also shows that the
forecast was weakened by training with air temperature (both wet bulb and dry
bulb), air pressure, and wind speed. Adding solar elevation angle performed
approximately the same as the base case.

Figure \ref{fig:demand04} shows the 4-hour interval forecast with the lowest
RMSE. Solar elevation angle improved the
forecast more than any other meteorological input. Table \ref{tab:demand04}
shows that humidity, air pressure, dry bulb temperature, and wind speed
worsened the forecast.

This implementation performance is consistent with previous applications
of \glspl{esn} to the task of predicting electric load
\cite{deihimi_application_2012}. Further, these results indicate that
\glspl{esn} perform better than other machine learning techniques, \gls{lstm} \cite{marino_building_2016}, Sequence to Sequence (S2S)
\cite{marino_building_2016}, and support vector regression \cite{chen_day-ahead_2017}, for predicting energy demand.

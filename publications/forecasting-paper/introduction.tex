\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
Reducing carbon emissions has become a priority for many countries in response
to the rising threat of climate change. The goal set by the 2015 Paris
Agreement is to prevent the global temperature from rising more than 1.5
$^\circ$C above pre-industrial levels \cite{noauthor_paris_nodate}. Virtually
all current plans to reduce carbon emissions depend on increasing the share of
energy production by renewable and clean energy sources, especially solar and
wind energy \cite{cany_nuclear_2018, chilvers_realising_2017,99th_general_assembly_illinois_2016,isee_illinois_2015}.
 While solar and wind are low-carbon sources, these
forms of electricity generation are variable and unpredictable. This variability
is found to be major cause of blackouts and power system failures
\cite{haes_alhelou_survey_2019}. Further, even modest penetrations of renewable
energy negatively affect the economics of other types of clean energy, such as
nuclear power
\cite{cany_nuclear_2018,keppler_carbon_2011,illinois_commerce_commision_icc_potential_2015}. This may force nuclear plants to shutdown prematurely, at the
precise moment clean sources of energy are most needed. There has been
some work done to quantify the economic benefit of improving forecasts of
renewable energy \cite{wang_quantifying_2016, mc_garrigle_quantifying_2015, brancucci_martinez-anido_value_2016}. Some of the benefits of improving
forecasts are: 1) It is often cheaper than building storage devices
\cite{wang_quantifying_2016}. 2) Would reduce curtailment and allow for
efficient use of non-renewable sources \cite{mc_garrigle_quantifying_2015}.
3) Enable a slight, but important, amount of load-following from nuclear and
bio-mass generators which are not designed for rapid load following
\cite{brancucci_martinez-anido_value_2016}. Most proposed forecasting
improvements involve new algorithms or machine learning techniques. However,
one of the simplest approaches to improving forecasts is to improve the
training data for such algorithms. There is a veritable zoo of weather
parameters that can supplement target training data and we don't know \textit{a
priori} which of these parameters will be helpful or detrimental to model
performance. In this paper, we evaluate several common parameters for use
in renewable energy forecasting with \glspl{esn}.
\subsection{Why Echo State Networks}
\glspl{esn} have several appealing features. They are simple, consisting only
of a large sparse reservoir and a single output layer
\cite{lukosevicius_practical_2012}; flexible and generalizable
where other network architectures require significant fine tuning
\cite{noauthor_deterministic_2019}; and fast, due to their simple structure and
very few trainable weights relative to other neural networks. Additionally,
\glspl{esn} have been shown to outperform other prediction techniques
\cite{jayawardene_comparison_2014,jayawardene_comparison_2015,shi_energy_2016,chitsazan_wind_2019, hu_forecasting_2020}.

Classical \glspl{esn} have previously been used to forecast demand, wind energy, and solar energy \cite{deihimi_application_2012,jayawardene_comparison_2015,hu_forecasting_2020}.
\glspl{esn} are typically used to make very short term predictions, on the
order of seconds or minutes
\cite{chen_novel_2019,wang_echo_2019,chitsazan_wind_2019}, one-hour ahead
\cite{shi_energy_2016}, up to a single day ahead
\cite{deihimi_application_2012}. Forecasts need to be multiple-hours to a
couple of days ahead to aid unit commitment and grid-scale energy economy
\cite{wang_quantifying_2016,mc_garrigle_quantifying_2015,brancucci_martinez-anido_value_2016}. In this work we use a classic \gls{esn} architecture to
forecast total demand, wind production, and solar production, 4-hours and 48-hours ahead.

There has been a lot of work to improve the forecasting capability of
the basic \gls{esn}. Approaches include adding multiple reservoirs
\cite{hu_forecasting_2020,gallicchio_deep_2019,yao_novel_2019,li_multi-reservoir_2020}; including non-linear units \cite{holzmann_echo_2008, chitsazan_wind_2019}; combining with other network architecture
\cite{chen_novel_2019, lopez_wind_2018}; and using a particle swarm approach \cite{chouikhi_pso-based_2017,wang_echo_2019}. Some works mention that
including weather parameters may be useful for renewable energy forecasting
\cite{li_echo_2019,chitsazan_wind_2019} but none have demonstrated the effect
each parameter has on model performance. The primary goal of this work
is to fill that gap.

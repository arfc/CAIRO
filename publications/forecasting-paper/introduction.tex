\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Motivation}
In response to the rising threat of climate change many countries have prioritized reducing carbon emissions. The goal set by the 2015 Paris
Agreement is to prevent the global temperature from rising more than 1.5
$^\circ$C above pre-industrial levels \cite{noauthor_paris_nodate}. Virtually
all current plans to reduce carbon emissions depend on increasing the share of
energy production by renewable and clean energy sources, especially solar and
wind \cite{cany_nuclear_2018, chilvers_realising_2017,99th_general_assembly_illinois_2016,isee_illinois_2015}.
 While solar and wind are low-carbon sources, these
forms of electricity generation increase variability, which can lead to
blackouts and power system failures
\cite{haes_alhelou_survey_2019}. Further, even modest penetrations of renewable
energy negatively affect the economics of other types of clean energy, such as
nuclear power
\cite{cany_nuclear_2018,keppler_carbon_2011,illinois_commerce_commision_icc_potential_2015}. This may force nuclear plants to shut down prematurely, at the
precise moment all clean sources of energy are most needed. There has been
some work done to quantify the economic benefit of improving forecasts of
renewable energy \cite{wang_quantifying_2016, mc_garrigle_quantifying_2015, brancucci_martinez-anido_value_2016}. Improving renewable energy forecasts can
mitigate some of the negative side effects of variability. The economic
benefits of better  forecasts include: reduced costs compared to building
storage devices \cite{wang_quantifying_2016}; curtailment reduction and more
efficient use of non-renewable sources \cite{mc_garrigle_quantifying_2015}; and
a slight, but important, amount of load-following from nuclear and biomass
generators, which are unable to follow rapid changes in demand
\cite{brancucci_martinez-anido_value_2016}. Most proposed forecasting
improvements involve new algorithms or machine learning techniques. However,
one of the simplest approaches to improving forecasts is to improve the
training data for such algorithms. There is a veritable zoo of weather
parameters that can supplement target training data, but we don't know \textit{a
priori} which of these parameters will be helpful or detrimental to model
performance. In this paper, we evaluate several common parameters for use
in renewable energy forecasting with \glspl{esn}.
\subsection{Why Echo State Networks}
\glspl{esn} have several appealing features. They are simple, consisting only
of a large, sparse, reservoir and a single output layer
\cite{lukosevicius_practical_2012}; flexible and generalizable,
while other network architectures require significant fine tuning
\cite{liu_deterministic_2019}; and fast, due to their simple structure and
few trainable weights relative to other neural networks. The \gls{esn} network
architecture eliminates the need for complicated data pre-processing, such as
feature extraction, that is required for other machine learning  and statistical
algorithms \cite{lazos_optimisation_2014, chen_day-ahead_2017}.
\glspl{esn} have also been shown to outperform other prediction techniques
\cite{jayawardene_comparison_2014,jayawardene_comparison_2015,shi_energy_2016,chitsazan_wind_2019, hu_forecasting_2020}.

Classical \glspl{esn} have previously been used to forecast demand, wind energy, and solar energy \cite{deihimi_application_2012,jayawardene_comparison_2015,hu_forecasting_2020}.
\glspl{esn} are typically used to make extreme short term predictions, on the
order of seconds or minutes
\cite{chen_novel_2019,wang_echo_2019,chitsazan_wind_2019}, one-hour ahead
\cite{shi_energy_2016}, up to a single day ahead
\cite{deihimi_application_2012}. Forecasts must be multiple-hours to a
couple of days ahead to aid unit commitment and grid-scale energy economy
\cite{wang_quantifying_2016,mc_garrigle_quantifying_2015,brancucci_martinez-anido_value_2016}. In this work we use a classic \gls{esn} architecture to
forecast total demand, wind production, and solar production, 4-hours and 48-hours ahead.

There has been a lot of work to improve the forecasting capability of
the basic \gls{esn}. Approaches include adding multiple reservoirs
\cite{hu_forecasting_2020,gallicchio_deep_2019,yao_novel_2019,li_multi-reservoir_2020}; including non-linear units \cite{holzmann_echo_2008, chitsazan_wind_2019}; combining with other network architecture
\cite{chen_novel_2019, lopez_wind_2018}; and using a particle swarm approach \cite{chouikhi_pso-based_2017,wang_echo_2019}. Some works mention that
including weather parameters may be useful for renewable energy forecasting
\cite{li_echo_2019,chitsazan_wind_2019} but none have demonstrated the effect
each parameter has on model performance. The primary goal of this work
is to fill that gap.

\subsection{Contributions}
In this work, we use \glspl{esn} for three main prediction tasks: total
electricity demand, wind energy production, and solar energy production. We
split these tasks into further sub tasks; predicting 4-hours ahead and 48-
hours ahead. These predictions facilitate scheduling and grid planning
because current market rules put renewable energy on the grid first, forcing
conventional power generators to work around this variability
\cite{wang_quantifying_2016}. Using \glspl{esn} to make predictions two-days
ahead is unique to this paper since the longest predictions by \glspl{esn} in the
literature only reach one-day ahead \cite{deihimi_application_2012}. Finally, we
repeat these tasks with several commonly used weather parameters and evaluate
their effect on model performance. The need to consider exogenous meteorological
inputs has been noted previously. Suprisingly, sun elevation is seldom used as a
correlated quantity for energy demand and wind power.

The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we discuss how data
were selected and processed, and we review \glspl{esn}. Section 3 shows a
benchmarking
exercise for our \gls{esn} implementation and presents the results. We discuss
the results and future implications in Section 4.

	abstract = {As a recurrent neural network that requires no training, the reservoir computing ({RC}) model has attracted widespread attention in the last decade, especially in the context of time series prediction. However, most time series have a multiscale structure, which a single-hidden-layer {RC} model may have diﬃculty capturing. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple projection-encoding hierarchical reservoir computing framework called Deep Projection-encoding Echo State Network ({DeePr}-{ESN}). The most distinctive feature of our model is its ability to learn multiscale dynamics through stacked {ESNs}, connected via subspace projections. Speciﬁcally, when an input time series is projected into the highdimensional echo-state space of a reservoir, a subsequent encoding layer (e.g., an autoencoder or {PCA}) projects the echo-state representations into a lower-dimensional feature space. These representations are the principal components of the echo-state representations, which removes the high frequency components of the representations. These can then be processed by another {ESN} through random connections. By using projection layers and encoding layers alternately, our {DeePr}-{ESN} can provide much more robust generalization performance than previous methods, and also fully takes advantage of the temporal kernel property of {ESNs} to encode the multiscale dynamics of time series. In our experiments, the {DeePr}-{ESNs} outperform both standard {ESNs} and existing hierarchical reservoir computing models on some artiﬁcial and real-world time series prediction tasks.},

	abstract = {Among the various architectures of Recurrent Neural Networks, Echo State Networks ({ESNs}) emerged due to their simplified and inexpensive training procedure. These networks are known to be sensitive to the setting of hyper-parameters, which critically affect their behavior. Results show that their performance is usually maximized in a narrow region of hyper-parameter space called edge of criticality. Finding such a region requires searching in hyper-parameter space in a sensible way: hyper-parameter configurations marginally outside such a region might yield networks exhibiting fully developed chaos, hence producing unreliable computations. The performance gain due to optimizing hyper-parameters can be studied by considering the memory–nonlinearity trade-off, i.e., the fact that increasing the nonlinear behavior of the network degrades its ability to remember past inputs, and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a model of {ESNs} that eliminates critical dependence on hyper-parameters, resulting in networks that provably cannot enter a chaotic regime and, at the same time, denotes nonlinear behavior in phase space characterized by a large memory of past inputs, comparable to the one of linear networks. Our contribution is supported by experiments corroborating our theoretical findings, showing that the proposed model displays dynamics that are rich-enough to approximate many common nonlinear systems used for benchmarking.},

Specifically, we attempt to utilize machine learning as the essential tool for integrating the use of past data into predictions. In order to facilitate scalability to the common scenario of interest where the spatiotemporally chaotic system is very large and complex, we propose combining two approaches: (i) a parallel machine learning prediction scheme and (ii) a hybrid technique for a composite prediction system composed of a knowledge-based component and a machine learning-based component. We demonstrate that not only can this method combining (i) and (ii) be scaled to give excellent performance for very large systems but also that the length of time series data needed to train our multiple, parallel machine learning components is dramatically less than that necessary without parallelization. Furthermore, considering cases where computational realization of the knowledge-based component does not resolve subgrid-scale processes, our scheme is able to use training data to incorporate the effect of the unresolved short-scale dynamics upon the resolved longer-scale dynamics (subgrid-scale closure).},

We highlight advantages and limitations of each method and discuss their implementation for parallel computing architectures. We quantify the relative prediction accuracy of these algorithms for the long-term forecasting of chaotic systems using as benchmarks the Lorenz-96 and the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky ({KS}) equations. We find that, when the full state dynamics are available for training, {RC} outperforms {BPTT} approaches in terms of predictive performance and in capturing of the long-term statistics, while at the same time requiring much less training time. However, in the case of reduced order data, large scale {RC} models can be unstable and more likely than the {BPTT} algorithms to diverge. In contrast, {RNNs} trained via {BPTT} show superior forecasting abilities and capture well the dynamics of reduced order systems. Furthermore, the present study quantifies for the first time the Lyapunov Spectrum of the {KS} equation with {BPTT}, achieving similar accuracy as {RC}. This study establishes that {RNNs} are a potent computational framework for the learning and forecasting of complex spatiotemporal systems.},

It is shown in particular that the variability of the local Lyapunov exponents (corresponding to the dominant Lyapunov exponent) decreases when the model resolution increases. The dynamics of (finite-amplitude) initial condition errors in these models is also reviewed, and in general found to display a complicated growth far from the asymptotic estimates provided by the Lyapunov exponents. The implications of these results for operational (high resolution) atmospheric and climate modelling are also discussed.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00851},
	abstract = {We propose a method to learn deep {ReLU}-based classifiers that are provably robust against norm-bounded adversarial perturbations on the training data. For previously unseen examples, the approach is guaranteed to detect all adversarial examples, though it may flag some non-adversarial examples as well. The basic idea is to consider a convex outer approximation of the set of activations reachable through a norm-bounded perturbation, and we develop a robust optimization procedure that minimizes the worst case loss over this outer region (via a linear program). Crucially, we show that the dual problem to this linear program can be represented itself as a deep network similar to the backpropagation network, leading to very efficient optimization approaches that produce guaranteed bounds on the robust loss. The end result is that by executing a few more forward and backward passes through a slightly modified version of the original network (though possibly with much larger batch sizes), we can learn a classifier that is provably robust to any norm-bounded adversarial attack. We illustrate the approach on a number of tasks to train classifiers with robust adversarial guarantees (e.g. for {MNIST}, we produce a convolutional classifier that provably has less than 5.8\% test error for any adversarial attack with bounded \${\textbackslash}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty\$ norm less than \${\textbackslash}epsilon = 0.1\$), and code for all experiments in the paper is available at https://github.com/locuslab/convex\_adversarial.},

	abstract = {Machine learning ({ML}) models, e.g., deep neural networks ({DNNs}), are vulnerable to adversarial examples: malicious inputs modified to yield erroneous model outputs, while appearing unmodified to human observers. Potential attacks include having malicious content like malware identified as legitimate or controlling vehicle behavior. Yet, all existing adversarial example attacks require knowledge of either the model internals or its training data. We introduce the first practical demonstration of an attacker controlling a remotely hosted {DNN} with no such knowledge. Indeed, the only capability of our black-box adversary is to observe labels given by the {DNN} to chosen inputs. Our attack strategy consists in training a local model to substitute for the target {DNN}, using inputs synthetically generated by an adversary and labeled by the target {DNN}. We use the local substitute to craft adversarial examples, and find that they are misclassified by the targeted {DNN}. To perform a real-world and properly-blinded evaluation, we attack a {DNN} hosted by {MetaMind}, an online deep learning {API}. We find that their {DNN} misclassifies 84.24\% of the adversarial examples crafted with our substitute. We demonstrate the general applicability of our strategy to many {ML} techniques by conducting the same attack against models hosted by Amazon and Google, using logistic regression substitutes. They yield adversarial examples misclassified by Amazon and Google at rates of 96.19\% and 88.94\%. We also find that this black-box attack strategy is capable of evading defense strategies previously found to make adversarial example crafting harder.},

This paper discusses a coupled point kinetics model and a two-dimensional diffusion model. The former is based on the point kinetics equations with six groups of delayed neutrons and the lumped capacitance heat transfer equations. To account for the reflector effect on neutron lifetime, additional (fictional) groups of delayed neutrons are added in the point kinetics equations to represent the thermalized neutrons coming back from the reflectors. The latter is based on coupled multi-group neutron diffusion and finite element heat transfer model. Multi-group cross sections and diffusion coefficients are generated using the Monte Carlo code Serpent and defined as input in {COMSOL} 5.0.},

	abstract = {Nuclear power plants are used extensively as base load sources of electricity. This is the most
economical and technically simple mode of operation. In this mode, power changes are limited to
frequency regulation for grid stability purposes and shutdowns for safety purposes.
However for countries with high nuclear shares or desiring to significantly increase renewable energy
sources, the question arises as to the ability of nuclear power plants to follow load on a regular basis,
including daily variations of the power demand.
This report considers the capability of nuclear power plants to follow load and the associated issues
that arise when operating in a load following mode. The report was initiated as part of the {NEA} study
“System effects of nuclear power”. It provided a detailed analysis of the technical and economic aspects of
load-following with nuclear power plants, and summarises the impact of load-following on the operational
mode, fuel performance and ageing of large equipment components of the plant.},

As the cost of sensors decreases while their power increases, distributed sensor networks become a more attractive option for implementation in power plants. In this work, we investi- gate the use of a distributed sensor network to achieve highly accurate measurements. We apply shaped rewards to local components and use a simple learning algorithm at each sen- sor in order to maximize those rewards. Our results show that the measurements from a sensor network trained us- ing shaped rewards are up to two orders of magnitude more accurate than a sensor network trained with a traditional global reward. Further, the algorithm proposed scales well to large networks, and is robust to measurement noise and sensor failures.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0048v1},
	doi = {10.1613/jair.1437},
	abstract = {In this paper, we confront the problem of applying reinforcement learning to
agents that perceive the environment through many sensors and that can perform
parallel actions using many actuators as is the case in complex autonomous
robots. We argue that reinforcement learning can only be successfully applied
to this case if strong assumptions are made on the characteristics of the
environment in which the learning is performed, so that the relevant sensor
readings and motor commands can be readily identified. The introduction of such
assumptions leads to strongly-biased learning systems that can eventually lose
the generality of traditional reinforcement-learning algorithms. In this line,
we observe that, in realistic situations, the reward received by the robot
depends only on a reduced subset of all the executed actions and that only a
reduced subset of the sensor inputs (possibly different in each situation and
for each action) are relevant to predict the reward. We formalize this property
in the so called 'categorizability assumption' and we present an algorithm that
takes advantage of the categorizability of the environment, allowing a decrease
in the learning time with respect to existing reinforcement-learning
algorithms. Results of the application of the algorithm to a couple of
simulated realistic-robotic problems (landmark-based navigation and the
six-legged robot gait generation) are reported to validate our approach and to
compare it to existing flat and generalization-based reinforcement-learning
approaches.},

	abstract = {Over the last few decades, a number of reinforcement learning techniques have emerged, and different reinforcement learning-based applications have proliferated. However, such techniques tend to specialize in a particular field. This is an obstacle to their generalization and extrapolation to other areas. Besides, neither the reward-punishment (r-p) learning process nor the convergence of results is fast and efficient enough. To address these obstacles, this research proposes a general reinforcement learning model. This model is independent of input and output types and based on general bioinspired principles that help to speed up the learning process. The model is composed of a perception module based on sensors whose specific perceptions are mapped as perception patterns. In this manner, similar perceptions (even if perceived at different positions in the environment) are accounted for by the same perception pattern. Additionally, the model includes a procedure that statistically associates perception-action pattern pairs depending on the positive or negative results output by executing the respective action in response to a particular perception during the learning process. To do this, the model is fitted with a mechanism that reacts positively or negatively to particular sensory stimuli in order to rate results. The model is supplemented by an action module that can be configured depending on the maneuverability of each specific agent. The model has been applied in the air navigation domain, a field with strong safety restrictions, which led us to implement a simulated system equipped with the proposed model. Accordingly, the perception sensors were based on Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast ({ADS}-B) technology, which is described in this paper. The results were quite satisfactory, and it outperformed traditional methods existing in the literature with respect to learning reliability and efficiency.},

This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration.

	abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account1, deeply rooted in psychological2 and neuroscientific3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems4,5, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms3. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains6,7,8, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks9,10,11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games12. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning to scale to problems that were previously intractable, such as learning to play video games directly from pixels. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms are also applied to robotics, allowing control policies for robots to be learned directly from camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the general field of reinforcement learning, then progress to the main streams of value-based and policy-based methods. Our survey will cover central algorithms in deep reinforcement learning, including the deep \$Q\$-network, trust region policy optimisation, and asynchronous advantage actor-critic. In parallel, we highlight the unique advantages of deep neural networks, focusing on visual understanding via reinforcement learning. To conclude, we describe several current areas of research within the field.},

	abstract = {Nuclear power plants are known as low carbon baseload electricity generating options, but can they become sufficiently flexible to follow the fluctuating demand economically? Small modular reactors, conceived to address the issues associated with large sized nuclear reactors such as safety, costs, and completion timeline, can offer some flexibility through modularity. However, there remain the questions of whether and how these advanced concepts could become commercially viable for load-following electricity production. From the perspective of integrated long-term energy planning and in a scenario-based approach, this study is conceived to evaluate the economic feasibility of flexible energy productions from two first-of-a-kind demonstration projects; namely a floating nuclear power plant {KLT}-40S in Russia and a high temperature reactor pebble-bed module or {HTR}-{PM} in China. Although both projects are solely designed for electric-application, this study proposes the evaluation of a load-following arrangement through the co-production of hydrogen and the integration of grid-connected battery energy storage systems. All scenarios are investigated using a conservative or a reasonable worst-case approach so as to contribute to setting the bottom line for future commercial deployment of small modular reactors. Findings suggest that small modular reactors can already be commercially deployed in the short-to mid-term, and there are opportunities for further cost reductions through technological innovation and economies of repeat project implementation.},

	abstract = {Global energy consumption is expected to increase significantly due to the growth of the economy and population. The utilization of fossil resource, especially coal, will likely be constrained by carbon dioxide emissions, known to be the principal contributor to climate change. Therefore, the world is facing the challenge of how to utilize fossil resource without a large carbon footprint. In the present work, a nuclear–coal hybrid energy system is proposed as a potential solution to the aforementioned challenge. A high-carbon energy such as coal is integrated effectively with a low-carbon energy such as nuclear in a flexible and optimized manner, which is able to generate the chemicals and fuels with low carbon dioxide emissions. The nuclear–coal hybrid energy system is presented in this paper for the detailed analysis. In this case, the carbon resource required by the fuel syntheses and chemical production processes is mainly provided by coal while the hydrogen resource is derived from nuclear energy. Such integration can not only lead to a good balance between carbon and hydrogen, but also improve both energy and carbon efficiencies. More importantly, a significantly lower {CO}2 emission intensity is achieved. A systematic techno-economic model is established, and a scenario analysis is carried out on the hybrid system to assess the economic competitiveness based on the considerations of various types of externalities. It is found that with the rising carbon tax and coal price as well as the decreasing cost of nuclear energy, the hybrid energy system will become more and more economically competitive with the conventional option, which make it a potential viable solution for the future carbon-constrained world.},

	abstract = {Reservoir computers are a subset of neural networks that behave as a dynamical
system rather than a function. This makes reservoir computers uniquely suited to
solving problems that involve time series data, but how they do so is not well understood. This thesis covers the background and implementation of reservoir computers,
before discussing the effects of linear memory and nonlinear computational ability.
We use reservoir computers with either exclusively linear memory, a combination of
linear memory and nonlinear computational ability, or exclusively nonlinear computational ability. As a first task, we show that these reservoir computers can act as
observers for the Lorenz and R¨ossler chaotic systems, i.e. they are able to predict
unobserved dynamical variables of these systems. We find that while the reservoir
with a combination of linear memory and nonlinear computation usually performs
better as an observer, for some tasks either linear memory or nonlinear computation
is not necessary to accurately make inferences about the system. Next, the linear
and combination linear/nonlinear reservoirs were tasked with “learning” the Lorenz
or R¨ossler attractor. The combination reservoir was able to learn the attractors, but
the linear reservoir was not. Lastly, coupled map lattice dynamics were generated
experimentally and in silico, and used to see if reservoir computers with a nonlinear
activation function could function as observers for a dataset with spatial extent. We
found an optimized parameter set that enabled the reservoir computer to predict the
dynamics of the unobserved nodes of a 1D lattice when given the dynamics of a few
nodes within the lattice. We found that, in principle, the reservoir could also function
as an observer for a 2D lattice, though the spatiotemporal dynamics of our particular
2D lattice were too complex for any reservoir size we used.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a recurrent neural network model to make medium-to-long term predictions, i.e. time horizon of ⩾1 week, of electricity consumption profiles in commercial and residential buildings at one-hour resolution. Residential and commercial buildings are responsible for a significant fraction of the overall energy consumption in the U.S. With advances in sensors and smart technologies, there is a need for medium to long-term prediction of electricity consumption in residential and commercial buildings at hourly intervals to support decision making pertaining to operations, demand response strategies, and installation of distributed generation systems. The modeler may have limited access to information about building’s schedules and equipment, making data-driven machine learning models attractive. The energy consumption data that is available may also contain blocks of missing data, making time-series predictions difficult. Thus, the main objectives of this paper are: (a) Develop and optimize novel deep recurrent neural network ({RNN}) models aimed at medium to long term electric load prediction at one-hour resolution; (b) Analyze the relative performance of the model for different types of electricity consumption patterns; and (c) Use the deep {NN} to perform imputation on an electricity consumption dataset containing segments of missing values. The proposed models were used to predict hourly electricity consumption for the Public Safety Building in Salt Lake City, Utah, and for aggregated hourly electricity consumption in residential buildings in Austin, Texas. For predicting the commercial building’s load profiles, the proposed {RNN} sequence-to-sequence models generally correspond to lower relative error when compared with the conventional multi-layered perceptron neural network. For predicting aggregate electricity consumption in residential buildings, the proposed model generally does not provide gains in accuracy compared to the multi-layered perceptron model.},

	abstract = {Ensuring sustainability demands more efficient energy management with minimized energy wastage. Therefore, the power grid of the future should provide an unprecedented level of flexibility in energy management. To that end, intelligent decision making requires accurate predictions of future energy demand/load, both at aggregate and individual site level. Thus, energy load forecasting have received increased attention in the recent past. However, it has proven to be a difficult problem. This paper presents a novel energy load forecasting methodology based on Deep Neural Networks, specifically, Long Short Term Memory ({LSTM}) algorithms. The presented work investigates two {LSTM} based architectures: 1) standard {LSTM} and 2) {LSTM}-based Sequence to Sequence (S2S) architecture. Both methods were implemented on a benchmark data set of electricity consumption data from one residential customer. Both architectures were trained and tested on one hour and one-minute time-step resolution datasets. Experimental results showed that the standard {LSTM} failed at one-minute resolution data while performing well in one-hour resolution data. It was shown that S2S architecture performed well on both datasets. Further, it was shown that the presented methods produced comparable results with the other deep learning methods for energy forecasting in literature.},

In this work, the development of an integrated power plant model is presented. This model is validated against steady-state data from a subcritical power plant with reheat and regenerative cycles. The coal-fired power plant model studied has nominal power generation of 605MW and efficiency of 38.3\%. Traditional, regulatory control architectures are incorporated into and tuned with the dynamic power plant model. Dynamic simulation shows that the plant model is stable for sudden changes in coal load, and the controllers are able to maintain the controlled variables at their set points. In this two-part publication, we present the complete workflow of data collection, model development and validation, control tuning, dynamic optimization formulation and solution, and supervisory control architecture for a coal-fired subcritical power plant. Part I focuses on elements of model development and analysis, illustrating the advantages of acausal, object-oriented modeling in power plant simulation. Part {II} illustrates the use of this model for efficiency optimization under transient part-load operation.},

Accordingly it is very important to collect {HRA} data from diverse sources as much as possible, which should be done based on a firm technical underpinning. In this regard, Park et al. proposed a novel framework that allows us to systematically calculate the number of task opportunities from the investigation reports reflecting the operation experience of domestic nuclear power plants [1]. In this study, based on the proposed framework, the nominal {HEPs} of 15 task types are quantified based on the number of task opportunities calculated from the 13 investigation reports stemming from diverse human errors. Although there are several limitations to be technically resolved, the results of this study are meaningful because we are able to take the first step in securing {HRA} data from investigation reports that reflect the operation experience of domestic {NPPs}.},

The mathematical model of the {MMNPP} consisting of two small modular reactor units, a steam header and three steam consuming units, (two-to-three {MMNPP}) was developed, including a nonlinear point reactor core model with six-group delayed neutron, an once-through steam generator ({OTSG}) model based on the moving boundary concept and a lumped parameter header model. Then linearization method was applied to the header model to obtain the corresponding transfer function model based on which feedforward compensators for header outlet valves were designed and integrated into the header steam pressure control system. It has been demonstrated by numerical simulation results that the developed header steam pressure control system with valve opening compensators can alleviate the coupling effect among header outlet flowrates, leading to much safer and more stable operations of the {MMNPP} than the existing header steam pressure control system without valve opening compensators. The control strategy given in this paper can be extended to more complex {MMNPPs}.},

In France, nuclear is the first contributor to today's low-carbon power mix and it will, tomorrow, be challenged by the increase of variable renewable energy sources. This paper develops a prospective approach to examine the solicitations that nuclear will have to face, for several scenarios. Results show that, with the penetration of renewable energy sources, the number of extreme nuclear power ramps and amplitudes variations increase, as well as the number of annually required shut-downs/start-ups events per reactor, even if the nuclear capacity was to be lowered. Beyond 30\% wind and solar penetration, complementary flexibility options will have to be leveraged.},

Thus, purveyors of technologies that traditionally have provided base-load electricity—such as nuclear power plants—can explore new operating procedures to deal with the associated market signals. Concurrently, innovations in nuclear reactor design coupled with sophisticated control systems now allow for more complex apportionment of heat within an integrated system such as one linked to energy-intensive chemical processes. This paper explores one opportunity – nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems. These are defined as integrated facilities comprised of nuclear reactors, renewable energy generation, and industrial processes that can simultaneously address the need for grid flexibility, greenhouse gas emission reductions, and optimal use of investment capital. Six aspects of interaction (interconnections) between elements of nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems are identified: Thermal, electrical, chemical, hydrogen, mechanical, and information. Additionally, system-level aspects affect selection, design, and operation of this hybrid system type. Throughout the paper, gaps and research needs are identified to promote further exploration of the topic.},

Such integrated energy systems are conceived as a nuclear power reactor coupled with renewable energy generation and industrial processes that may simultaneously tackle the concerns regarding grid flexibility, climate change, energy security, optimal return on invested capital, and settling public concerns. Apart from highlighting the key challenges associated with nuclear energy and renewable energy sources while operating as an independent power generation system, the present paper delineates the various aspects associated with integrated nuclear-renewable energy systems. It may be speculated that integrating nuclear energy and renewable energy into a single hybrid energy system, coupled through informatics linkages, would enable to overcome the demerits present when they operate individual.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08996},
	abstract = {It is a widely accepted fact that data representations intervene noticeably in machine learning tools. The more they are well defined the better the performance results are. Feature extraction-based methods such as autoencoders are conceived for finding more accurate data representations from the original ones. They efficiently perform on a specific task in terms of 1) high accuracy, 2) large short term memory and 3) low execution time. Echo State Network ({ESN}) is a recent specific kind of Recurrent Neural Network which presents very rich dynamics thanks to its reservoir-based hidden layer. It is widely used in dealing with complex non-linear problems and it has outperformed classical approaches in a number of tasks including regression, classification, etc. In this paper, the noticeable dynamism and the large memory provided by {ESN} and the strength of Autoencoders in feature extraction are gathered within an {ESN} Recurrent Autoencoder ({ESN}-{RAE}). In order to bring up sturdier alternative to conventional reservoir-based networks, not only single layer basic {ESN} is used as an autoencoder, but also Multi-Layer {ESN} ({ML}-{ESN}-{RAE}). The new features, once extracted from {ESN}'s hidden layer, are applied to classification tasks. The classification rates rise considerably compared to those obtained when applying the original data features. An accuracy-based comparison is performed between the proposed recurrent {AEs} and two variants of an {ELM} feed-forward {AEs} (Basic and {ML}) in both of noise free and noisy environments. The empirical study reveals the main contribution of recurrent connections in improving the classification performance results.},

	abstract = {Classification of multivariate time series ({MTS}) has been tackled with a large variety of methodologies and applied to a wide range of scenarios. Reservoir Computing ({RC}) provides efficient tools to generate a vectorial, fixed-size representation of the {MTS} that can be further processed by standard classifiers. Despite their unrivaled training speed, {MTS} classifiers based on a standard {RC} architecture fail to achieve the same accuracy of fully trainable neural networks. In this paper we introduce the reservoir model space, an unsupervised approach based on {RC} to learn vectorial representations of {MTS}. Each {MTS} is encoded within the parameters of a linear model trained to predict a low-dimensional embedding of the reservoir dynamics. Compared to other {RC} methods, our model space yields better representations and attains comparable computational performance, thanks to an intermediate dimensionality reduction procedure. As a second contribution we propose a modular {RC} framework for {MTS} classification, with an associated open-source Python library. The framework provides different modules to seamlessly implement advanced {RC} architectures. The architectures are compared to other {MTS} classifiers, including deep learning models and time series kernels. Results obtained on benchmark and real-world {MTS} datasets show that {RC} classifiers are dramatically faster and, when implemented using our proposed representation, also achieve superior classification accuracy.},

	abstract = {A microgrid system, be it connected to the utility grid or an independent system, usually consists of a mix of generation - renewable and non-renewable; loads - controllable or non-controllable and Energy Storage Systems ({ESSs}) such as batteries or flywheels. In order to determine how much power is utilized from the controllable resources such as {ESS}, diesel generators, micro-turbines or gas turbines, we first need to determine how much the demand is or how much the renewable energy sources are generating is which is accomplished using forecasting techniques. Due to the intermittent nature of renewable resources such as wind energy or solar energy, it is difficult to forecast wind power or solar power accurately. These forecasts are highly dependent on weather forecasts. It is evident that forecast of any data based on forecast of other parameters would lead to further inaccuracy, even if the relation between the inputs and output maybe predetermined through regression methods. Therefore, this paper illustrates an approach to use historical power data instead of numerical weather predictions to produce short-term forecast results. The concept is based on persistence method presented in [1]. This method uses the “today equals tomorrow” concept. From [2], we know that persistence technique produces results that are more accurate as compared to other forecasting techniques for a look-ahead time of 4-6 hours. Both [1] and [2] were based on wind power forecasting. In this paper, we investigate persistence method for short-term electrical demand, solar {PV} (Photovoltaic) power and wind power forecasting. Since the forecasts are dependent on historical averages of the data in the ‘near’ past, the accuracy is inversely proportional to the variation of power between the historical data and the actual data.},

We performed a case study of a real micro-neighbourhood comprising only 75 single-family houses. The obtained average prediction error was equivalent to 5.4 per cent of the maximal measured net load. The issues, i.e.: (1) the feasibility of micro-scale residential load forecasting taking into account renewable energy penetration, (2) the feasibility to predict net load with dense temporal resolution of 15 min, (3) the feature selection problem, (4) the proposed prosumption- and comparison-oriented prediction model key performance measure, could be of interest to engineers designing energy balancing systems for local smart grids.},

This research quantifies the value of wind power forecasting improvements in the {IEEE} 118-bus test system as modified to emulate the generation mixes of Midcontinent, California, and New England independent system operator balancing authority areas. To measure the economic value, a commercially available production cost modeling tool was used to simulate the multitimescale unit commitment ({UC}) and economic dispatch process for calculating the cost savings and curtailment reductions. To measure the reliability improvements, an in-house tool, Flexible energy scheduling tool for integrating variable generation, was used to calculate the system's area control error and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation Control Performance Standard 2. The approach allowed scientific reproducibility of results and cross validation of the tools. A total of 270 scenarios were evaluated to accommodate the variation of three factors: generation mix, wind penetration level, and wind forecasting improvements. The modified {IEEE} 118-bus systems utilized 1 year of data at multiple time scales, including the day-ahead {UC}, 4-h-ahead {UC}, and real-time dispatch. The value of improved wind power forecasting was found to be strongly tied to the conventional generation mix, existence of energy storage devices, and the penetration level of wind energy.

@report{clemmer_nuclear_2018,
	title = {The Nuclear Power Dilemma},
	abstract = {For decades, nuclear power has provided most of the
nation’s carbon-free electricity. However, the owners
have shut down many nuclear plants in the last five
years or announced plans to close them well before
their operating licenses expire, generating a discussion
among policymakers and regulators about the impact
of early retirements. The primary reasons for these
early closures are the economic challenges brought on
by cheap natural gas, diminished demand for
electricity, falling costs for renewable energy, rising
operating costs, and safety and performance problems.
The possibility that the nation will replace existing
nuclear plants with natural gas and coal rather than
low-carbon sources raises serious concerns about our
ability to achieve the deep cuts in carbon emissions
needed to limit the worst impacts of climate change.
 As of the end of 2017, 99 reactors at 60 power
plants provided 20 percent of {US} electricity
generation. The owners have retired six reactors at five
plants since 2013, slated seven reactors at five more
plants to retire over the next eight years, and
threatened to close five reactors at four more plants in
the next few years if they do not receive new financial
support.1
 In addition, Illinois, New Jersey, and New
York now provide financial support to keep 10 reactors at seven plants operating for at least 10 more years.
 The economic challenges facing nuclear plants are
part of a historic transition in the {US} electricity sector.
Over the last decade, natural gas generation and
renewable energy generation from wind and solar have
grown rapidly as their prices have fallen. Combined
with investments in energy efficiency, these energy
sources have largely replaced generation from retiring
coal plants, resulting in a 28 percent reduction in {US}
power-sector emissions of carbon dioxide ({CO}2) below
2005 levels in 2017. While nuclear power’s share of
electric power production has remained relatively flat
over the past decade, most analysts project that share
to decline in the future without additional financial or
policy support.
 The transition already has resulted in many
benefits, including lower electricity prices, technological innovation, a cleaner environment, and increased
customer control over energy use. However, in the
absence of national policy to reduce carbon emissions,
the transition has undervalued all types of low-carbon
sources of electricity and underpriced natural gas and
coal relative to their damage to the climate.
 The Union of Concerned Scientists ({UCS}) has
assessed the economic viability and performance of
most of the nuclear power plants operating in the
United States, analyzing which ones are most at risk of
early retirement and evaluating the main factors that
affect competitiveness. We also identified reactors that
have been safe, reliable performers and those with
troubled performance records. In addition, using a
national model of the electricity sector, {UCS} has
analyzed the impacts on the {US} electricity mix, {CO}2
emissions, and consumer electricity bills of three
scenarios for retiring nuclear plants early and two
scenarios based on the introduction of national policies
to reduce carbon emissions.},

	title = {Echo State Networks with Filter and a Delay\&Sum Readout},
	abstract = {Echo state networks ({ESNs}) are a novel approach to recurrent neural net-work training with the advantage of a very simple and linear learning algo-rithm. It has been demonstrated that {ESNs} outperform other methods on a number of benchmark tasks. Although the approach is appealing, there are still some inherent limitations in the original formulation. Here we suggest two enhancements of this network model. First, the pre-viously proposed idea of filters in neurons is extended to arbitrary infinite impulse response ({IIR}) filter neurons. This enables such networks to learn multiple attractors and signals at different timescales, which is especially important for modeling real-world time series. Second, a delay\&sum read-out is introduced, which adds trainable delays in the synaptic connections of output neurons and therefore vastly improves the memory capacity of echo state networks. It is shown in commonly used benchmark tasks and real-world examples, that this new structure is able to significantly outperform standard {ESNs} and other state-of-the-art models for nonlinear dynamical system modeling.},

	abstract = {Over the last couple of years, machine learning parameterizations have emerged as a potential way to improve the representation of sub-grid processes in Earth System Models ({ESMs}). So far, all studies were based on the same three-step approach: first a training dataset was created from a high-resolution simulation, then a machine learning algorithm was fitted to this dataset, before the trained algorithm was implemented in the {ESM}. The resulting online simulations were frequently plagued by instabilities and biases. Here, coupled online learning is proposed as a way to combat these issues. Coupled learning can be seen as a second training stage in which the pretrained machine learning parameterization, specifically a neural network, is run in parallel with a high-resolution simulation. The high-resolution simulation is kept in sync with the neural network-driven {ESM} through constant nudging. This enables the neural network to learn from the tendencies that the high-resolution simulation would produce if it experienced the states the neural network creates. The concept is illustrated using the Lorenz 96 model, where coupled learning is able to recover the "true" parameterizations. Further, detailed algorithms for the implementation of coupled learning in 3D cloud-resolving models and the super parameterization framework are presented. Finally, outstanding challenges and issues not resolved by this approach are discussed.},

The paper, which has never been published externally, presents what is widely known as the Lorenz 1996 model. Ed was unable to come to the 2002 meeting, but we decided it would be proper to acknowledge Ed's unrivalled contribution to the field of weather and climate predictability by publishing his 1996 paper in this volume.The difference between the state that a system is assumed or predicted to possess, and the state that it actually possesses or will possess, constitutes the error in specifying or forecasting the state. We identify the rate at which an error will typically grow or decay, as the range of prediction increases, as the key factor in determining the extent to which a system is predictable. The long-term average factor by which an infinitesimal error will amplify or diminish, per unit time, is the leading Lyapunov number; its logarithm, denoted by λ1, is the leading Lyapunov exponent. Instantaneous growth rates can differ appreciably from the average.With the aid of some simple models, we describe situations where errors behave as would be expected from a knowledge of λ1, and other situations, particularly in the earliest and latest stages of growth, where their behaviour is systematically different. Slow growth in the latest stages may be especially relevant to the long-range predictability of the atmosphere.},

The methods are: echo state network (a type of reservoir computing, {RC}-{ESN}), deep feed-forward artificial neural network ({ANN}), and recurrent neural network with long short-term memory ({RNN}-{LSTM}). This Lorenz 96 system has three tiers of nonlinearly interacting variables representing slow/large-scale (\$X\$), intermediate (\$Y\$), and fast/small-scale (\$Z\$) processes. For training or testing, only \$X\$ is available; \$Y\$ and \$Z\$ are never known or used. We show that {RC}-{ESN} substantially outperforms {ANN} and {RNN}-{LSTM} for short-term prediction, e.g., accurately forecasting the chaotic trajectories for hundreds of numerical solver's time steps, equivalent to several Lyapunov timescales. The {RNN}-{LSTM} and {ANN} show some prediction skills as well; {RNN}-{LSTM} bests {ANN}. Furthermore, even after losing the trajectory, data predicted by {RC}-{ESN} and {RNN}-{LSTM} have probability density functions ({PDFs}) that closely match the true {PDF}, even at the tails. The {PDF} of the data predicted using {ANN}, however, deviates from the true {PDF}. Implications, caveats, and applications to data-driven and data-assisted surrogate modeling of complex nonlinear dynamical systems such as weather/climate are discussed.},

	abstract = {We use recent advances in the machine learning area known as 'reservoir computing' to formulate a method for model-free estimation from data of the Lyapunov exponents of a chaotic process. The technique uses a limited time series of measurements as input to a high-dimensional dynamical system called a 'reservoir'. After the reservoir's response to the data is recorded, linear regression is used to learn a large set of parameters, called the 'output weights'. The learned output weights are then used to form a modified autonomous reservoir designed to be capable of producing arbitrarily long time series whose ergodic properties approximate those of the input signal. When successful, we say that the autonomous reservoir reproduces the attractor's 'climate'. Since the reservoir equations and output weights are known, we can compute derivatives needed to determine the Lyapunov exponents of the autonomous reservoir, which we then use as estimates of the Lyapunov exponents for the original input generating system. We illustrate the effectiveness of our technique with two examples, the Lorenz system, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky ({KS}) equation. In particular, we use the Lorenz system to show that achieving climate reproduction may require tuning of the reservoir parameters. For the case of the {KS} equation, we note that as the system's spatial size is increased, the number of Lyapunov exponents increases, thus yielding a challenging test of our method, which we find the method successfully passes.},

However, it is notoriously difficult to estimate these exponents reliably from experimental data due to the measurement error (noise). In this paper, a novel method for estimating Lyapunov exponents from a time series in the presence of additive noise corruption is presented. The method combines the ideas of averaging the noisy data to form new neighbors and of nonlinear mapping to determine neighborhood mapping matrices. Two case studies of balancing control of a bipedal robot and the Lorenz systems are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. The bipedal robot system has two negative Lyapunov exponents while the Lorenz system has one positive, zero, and negative exponents, respectively. It is shown that, as compared with the existing methods, our proposed one is more robust to the ratio of signal to noise, and is particularly effective in estimating negative Lyapunov exponents. We believe that the work can contribute significantly to the stability analysis of nonlinear systems using a noisy time series.},

Here a thorough analysis of the nature of predictability in the idealized system is developed by using a theoretical framework developed by R.K. This analysis is based on a relative entropy functional that has been shown elsewhere by one of the authors to measure the utility of statistical predictions precisely. The analysis is facilitated by the fact that most relevant probability distributions are approximately Gaussian if the initial conditions are assumed to be so. Rather surprisingly this holds for both the equilibrium (climatological) and nonequilibrium (prediction) distributions. We find that in most cases the absolute difference in the first moments of these two distributions (the “signal” component) is the main determinant of predictive utility variations. Contrary to conventional belief in the ensemble prediction area, the dispersion of prediction ensembles is generally of secondary importance in accounting for variations in utility associated with different initial conditions. This conclusion has potentially important implications for practical weather prediction, where traditionally most attention has focused on dispersion and its variability.},

	abstract = {Permutation entropy ({PE}) has been recently suggested as a novel measure to characterize the complexity of nonlinear time series. In this paper, we propose a simple method to address some of {PE}'s limitations, mainly its inability to differentiate between distinct patterns of a certain motif and the sensitivity of patterns close to the noise floor. The method relies on the fact that patterns may be too disparate in amplitudes and variances and proceeds by assigning weights for each extracted vector when computing the relative frequencies associated with every motif. Simulations were conducted over synthetic and real data for a weighting scheme inspired by the variance of each pattern. Results show better robustness and stability in the presence of higher levels of noise, in addition to a distinctive ability to extract complexity information from data with spiky features or having abrupt changes in magnitude.},

	abstract = {Successfully predicting the future states of systems that are complex, stochastic, and potentially chaotic is a major challenge. Model forecasting error ({FE}) is the usual measure of success; however model predictions provide no insights into the potential for improvement. In short, the realized predictability of a specific model is uninformative about whether the system is inherently predictable or whether the chosen model is a poor match for the system and our observations thereof. Ideally, model proficiency would be judged with respect to the systems’ intrinsic predictability, the highest achievable predictability given the degree to which system dynamics are the result of deterministic vs. stochastic processes. Intrinsic predictability may be quantified with permutation entropy ({PE}), a model-free, information-theoretic measure of the complexity of a time series. By means of simulations, we show that a correlation exists between estimated {PE} and {FE} and show how stochasticity, process error, and chaotic dynamics affect the relationship. This relationship is verified for a data set of 461 empirical ecological time series. We show how deviations from the expected {PE}–{FE} relationship are related to covariates of data quality and the nonlinearity of ecological dynamics. These results demonstrate a theoretically grounded basis for a model-free evaluation of a system's intrinsic predictability. Identifying the gap between the intrinsic and realized predictability of time series will enable researchers to understand whether forecasting proficiency is limited by the quality and quantity of their data or the ability of the chosen forecasting model to explain the data. Intrinsic predictability also provides a model-free baseline of forecasting proficiency against which modeling efforts can be evaluated.},

We conjecture that the inherent complexity of real-world time-series data, which results from the dimension, nonlinearity, and nonstationarity of the generating process, as well as from measurement issues such as noise, aggregation, and finite data length, is both empirically quantifiable and directly correlated with predictability. In particular, we argue that redundancy is an effective way to measure complexity and predictive structure in an experimental time series and that weighted permutation entropy is an effective way to estimate that redundancy. To validate these conjectures, we study 120 different time-series data sets. For each time series, we construct predictions using a wide variety of forecast models, then compare the accuracy of the predictions with the permutation entropy of that time series. We use the results to develop a model-free heuristic that can help practitioners recognize when a particular prediction method is not well matched to the task at hand: that is, when the time series has more predictive structure than that method can capture and exploit.},

	abstract = {The United Kingdom has placed itself on a transition towards a low-carbon economy and society, through the imposition of a legally-binding goal aimed at reducing its ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions by 80\% by 2050 against a 1990 baseline. A set of three low-carbon, socio-technical transition pathways were developed and analysed via an innovative collaboration between engineers, social scientists and policy analysts. The pathways focus on the power sector, including the potential for increasing use of low-carbon electricity for heating and transport, within the context of critical European Union developments and policies. Their development started from narrative storylines regarding different governance framings, drawing on interviews and workshops with stakeholders and analysis of historical analogies. The quantified {UK} pathways were named Market Rules, Central Co-ordination and Thousand Flowers; each reflecting a dominant logic of governance arrangements. The aim of the present contribution was to use these pathways to explore what is needed to realise a transition that successfully addresses the so-called energy policy ‘trilemma,’ i.e. the simultaneous delivery of low carbon, secure and affordable energy services. Analytical tools were developed and applied to assess the technical feasibility, social acceptability, and environmental and economic impacts of the pathways. Technological and behavioural developments were examined, alongside appropriate governance structures and regulations for these low-carbon transition pathways, as well as the roles of key energy system ‘actors’ (both large and small). An assessment of the part that could possibly be played by future demand side response was also undertaken in order to understand the factors that drive energy demand and energy-using behaviour, and reflecting growing interest in demand side response for balancing a system with high proportions of renewable generation. A set of interacting and complementary engineering and techno-economic models or tools were then employed to analyse electricity network infrastructure investment and operational decisions to assist market design and option evaluation. This provided a basis for integrating the analysis within a whole systems framework of electricity system development, together with the evaluation of future economic benefits, costs and uncertainties. Finally, the energy and environmental performance of the different energy mixes were appraised on a ‘life-cycle’ basis to determine the greenhouse gas emissions and other ecological or health burdens associated with each of the three transition pathways. Here, the challenges, insights and opportunities that have been identified over the transition towards a low-carbon future in the United Kingdom are described with the purpose of providing a valuable evidence base for developers, policy makers and other stakeholders.},

	abstract = {Power systems are the most complex systems and have great importance in modern life. They have direct impacts on the modernization, economic, political and social aspects. To operate such systems in a stable mode, several control and protection techniques are required. However, modern systems are equipped with several protection schemes with the aim of avoiding the unpredicted events and power outages, power systems are still encountering emergency and mal-operation situations. The most severe emergencies put the whole or at least a part of the system in danger. If the emergency is not well managed, the power system is likely to have cascading failures that might lead to a blackout. Due to the consequences, many countries around the world have research and expert teams who work to avoid blackouts on their systems. In this paper, a comprehensive review on the major blackouts and cascading events that have occurred in the last decade are introduced. A particular focus is given on the {US} power system outages and their causes since it is one of the leading power producers in the world and it is also due to the ready availability of data for the past events. The paper also highlights the root causes of different blackouts around the globe. Furthermore, blackout and cascading analysis methods and the consequences of blackouts are surveyed. Moreover, the challenges in the existing protective schemes and research gaps in the topic of power system blackout and cascading events are marked out. Research directions and issues to be considered in future power system blackout studies are also proposed.},

Based on time series analysis, a serially connected multi-reservoir echo state network ({MR}-{ESN}) is developed to predict solar irradiance. {MR}-{ESN} is a fast yet efficient approach, which makes use of the high efficiency of {ESN} and the advantages of deep learning. {MR}-{ESN} consists of multiple reservoirs in series, which are responsible for encoding the input signals into a richer state representation. The time series analysis is adopted to provide more appropriate input and output for {MR}-{ESN}. Various prediction horizons including one-hour-ahead and multi-hour-ahead prediction are conducted, respectively. The effect of reservoir layer number on the {MR}-{ESN} performance is explored in detail. Three internal qualitative indicators are adopted to investigate the performance differences of {MR}-{ESN}, i.e., probability distribution, correlation analysis, and principal component analysis ({PCA}) of network states. Simulation results demonstrate that {MR}-{ESN} outperforms than traditional {ESN}, backpropagation ({BP}) and Elman neural networks.},

The study is much attractive due to inclusion of weekends/holidays what makes {STLF} problem much more difﬁcult. The main aim is to show the great capabilities of {ESN} as a stand-alone forecaster to learn complex dynamics of hourly electric load time series and forecast the near future loads with high accuracies. {ESN} as the state-of-the-art recurrent neural network ({RNN}) gains a reservoir of dynamics tapped by trained output units with a simple and fast single-stage training process. Furthermore, the application of {ESN} to predict the target-hour temperature needed by {ESN}-based load forecasters is examined. Since temperature prediction errors affect load forecasting accuracy, effects of such errors on {ESN}-based load forecasting are studied by both sensitivity analysis and applying noisy temperature series. Real hourly load and temperature data of a North-American electric utility is used as the data set. The results reﬂect that the {ESN}-based {STLF} method provides load forecasts with acceptable high accuracy.},

Based on this, this paper proposed a novel combined model for wind speed forecasting, which combined hybrid models based on decomposition method and optimization algorithm. In this approach, four distinct hybrid models are proposed and to additionally enhance the forecasting performance, {ESN} (Echo state network) is initially applied to integrate all the results obtained by each hybrid model and achieve the ultimate forecasting results. Besides, a distinct data set division mechanism is adopted in the multi-step wind speed forecasting.

We present in this paper a novel energy prediction model that makes use of the altitude angle of the sun at different times of day to predict future solar energy availability. Unlike most of the state-of-the-art predictors that use past energy observations to make predictions, our model does not require one to maintain local energy harvesting patterns of past days.

Uncertainty of {PV} power generation causes frequency fluctuations and power system instabilities. Due to this, short term {PV} power prediction has become an important area of study. Short term {PV} power prediction supports proper decision-making in control centers. Power generation output of a {PV} plant is highly dependent on different weather conditions such as solar irradiance, temperature and cloud covers. Weather data analysis and prediction can be considered as big data due to its complexity and dynamically changing characteristics. In this paper, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system ({ANFIS}) is developed and compared with an echo state network ({ESN}) for short term {PV} power prediction. The {ANFIS} approach consists of three {ANFIS} modules for predicting solar irradiance and temperature, and then estimating the {PV} power, respectively. The {ESN} on the other hand predicts the {PV} power based on current weather parameters. A weather database containing data sampled every second is used in developing the {ANFIS} and {ESN} based {PV} power prediction systems.

	abstract = {Wind power generation has presented an important development around the world. However, its integration into electrical systems presents numerous challenges due to the variable nature of the wind. Therefore, to maintain an economical and reliable electricity supply, it is necessary to accurately predict wind generation. The Wind Power Prediction Tool ({WPPT}) has been proposed to solve this task using the power curve associated with a wind farm. Recurrent Neural Networks ({RNNs}) model complex non-linear relationships without requiring explicit mathematical expressions that relate the variables involved. In particular, two types of {RNN}, Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) and Echo State Network ({ESN}), have shown good results in time series forecasting. In this work, we present an {LSTM}+{ESN} architecture that combines the characteristics of both networks. An architecture similar to an {ESN} is proposed, but using {LSTM} blocks as units in the hidden layer. The training process of this network has two key stages: (i) the hidden layer is trained with a descending gradient method online using one epoch; (ii) the output layer is adjusted with a regularized regression. In particular, the case is proposed where Step (i) is used as a target for the input signal, in order to extract characteristics automatically as the autoencoder approach; and in the second stage (ii), a quantile regression is used in order to obtain a robust estimate of the expected target. The experimental results show that {LSTM}+{ESN} using the autoencoder and quantile regression outperforms the {WPPT} model in all global metrics used.},

However, due to the negative factors such as inaccurate numerical weather prediction and frequent ramping events, previous wind power prediction methods are difficult to meet actual needs for practical applications. To this end, this paper originally proposes a new wind power prediction method with high accuracy based on echo state network. This method is a hybrid of wavelet transform, echo state network and ensemble technique. Wavelet transform is used to decompose raw wind power time series data into different frequencies with better outliers and behaviors. Then, we adopt the echo state network to automatically learn the nonlinear mapping relationship between input and output in each frequency. Later, ensemble technique is applied to deal with the model misspecification and data noise problems, which are common in wind power prediction, thereby reducing the uncertainty of wind power forecasting and improving prediction accuracy. Finally, we use wind power data from real wind farms in Belgium and China to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The simulation results show that the proposed method is superior to other benchmark algorithms in prediction accuracy, which indicates that the method has high potentials for practical application in real electric power and energy systems.},

Solutions of these equations can be identified with trajectories in phase space. For those systems with bounded solutions, it is found that nonperiodic solutions are ordinarily unstable with respect to small modifications, so that slightly differing initial states can evolve into considerably different states. Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.},

	abstract = {In the context of global warming, increases in Antarctic surface air temperatures are expected, and have been found to be larger than in lower latitudes, both from modelling experiments and analysis of instrumental records. Nevertheless, Antarctic warming has not been evenly spread through the seasons or regionally. In this paper, we identify different regional responses to changes in temperature and pressure through the comparison of daily air surface temperature and pressure for two periods 1957–1973 ({PI}) and 1979–1995 (P2) for four Antarctic Stations (Faraday, Mawson, Halley and South Pole). These stations are characterised respectively with Antarctic Oceanic Climate, Ice Shelf Climate, Antarctic Katabatic Climate and Cold Continental Climate of the Eastern Plateau, four of the eight climatic types described for Antarctica by a multivariate analysis of the output of {NCEP}/{NCAR} Reanalyses (Aguilar, 2000).Dramatic differences are found in the evolution of air temperatures and air pressures at these meteorological stations and, by extension, in their climatic regions. The Antarctic Western Coast (here studied through Faraday and Halley stations) shows a strong and significant warming in winter and summer and no increases in the transition seasons. In contrast, the Antarctic Eastern Coast and the Antarctic Eastern Plateau (here represented by Mawson and South Pole respectively) show a slight but significant cooling, centred on the early winter period. The close relationship of variations in air temperature to changes in air pressure suggests a key role is played by changes in atmospheric circulation and induced effects like modification of sea-ice extents. An uneven response in temperature variations is evident, heavily dependent on regional topography and the different seasons of the year.},

	abstract = {By using data of daily electricity consumption and temperature for the period 2003–2007 in Shanghai, the variation of energy consumption and the correlations between energy consumption and temperature are analyzed. The results indicate that winter and summer are the two peak seasons of energy consumption due to the urban residential heating and cooling demand. The base temperature of electricity and daily temperature is 10°C in winter and 22°C in summer respectively. When the outdoor temperature is below 10°C, the heating demand becomes obvious, and with over 22°C the cooling demand. The spatial distribution of cooling degree-days ({CDD}) and heating degree-days ({HDD}) clearly shows urbanization effects. By the influence of urbanization the central city experiences greater {CDD} in summer and lower {HDD} in winter. The projected temperature for 2011–2050 implies a significant increase in {CDD} and a decrease in {HDD}. This may have implications on the future energy demand if the current energy consumption pattern does not change.

Our results confirm the non-linearity of the link between electricity consumption and temperature found in more limited geographical areas in previous studies. By distinguishing between North and South countries, we also find that this non-linear pattern is more pronounced in the warm countries. Finally, rolling regressions show that the sensitivity of electricity consumption to temperature in summer has increased in the recent period.},

	abstract = {Climate non-stationarity is a challenge for electric power infrastructure reliability; recordbreaking heat waves significantly affect peak demand [1], lower contingency capacities, and expose cities to risk of blackouts due to component failures and security threats. The United States’ electric grid operates safely for a wide range of load, weather, and power quality conditions. Projected increases in ambient air temperatures could, however, create operating conditions that place the grid outside the boundaries of current reliability tolerances. Advancements in long-term forecasting, including projections of rising air temperatures and more severe heat waves, present opportunities to advance risk management methods for long-term infrastructure planning. This is particularly evident in the {US} Southwest—a relatively hot region expected to experience significant temperature increases affecting electric loads, generation, and delivery systems. Generation capacity is typically built to meet the 90th percentile (T90) hottest peak demand, plus an additional reserve margin of least 15\%, but that may not be sufficient to ensure reliable power services if air temperatures are higher than expected. The problem with this T90 planning approach is that it requires a stationary climate to be completely effective. In reality, annual temperature differences can have more than a 15\% effect on system performance. Current long-term infrastructure planning and risk management processes are biased climate data choices that can significantly underestimate peak demand, overestimate generation capacity, and result in major power outages during heat waves. This study used downscaled global climate models ({GCMs}) to evaluate the effects of non-stationarity on air temperature forecasts, and a new high-level statistical approach was developed to consider the subsequent effects on peak demand, power generation, and local reserve margins ({LRMs}) compared to previous forecasting methods. Air temperature projections in {IPCC} {RCPs} 4.5 and 8.5 are that increases up to 6°C are possible by the end of century, with highs of 58°C and 56°C in Phoenix, Arizona and Los Angeles, California respectively. In the hottest scenarios, we estimated that {LRMs} for the two metro regions would be on average 30\% less than at respective T90s, which in the case of Los Angeles (a net importer) would require 5GW of additional power to meet electrical demand. We calculated these values by creating a structural equation model ({SEM}) for peak demand based on the physics of common {AC} units; physics-based models are necessary to predict demand under unprecedented conditions for which historical data do not exist. The {SEM} forecasts for peak demand were close to straight-line regression methods as in prior literature from 25–40°C (104°F), but diverged lower at higher temperatures. Power plant generation capacity derating factors were also modeled based on the electrical and thermal performance characteristics of different technologies. Lastly, we discussed several strategic options to reduce the risk of {LRM} shortages; including implementing technology, market incentives, and urban forms that reduce peak load and load variance per capita as well as their tradeoffs with several other stakeholder objectives.},

In this paper, the authors conduct a comprehensive study of existing feature preprocessing techniques to evaluate their empirical performance in time series forecasting.

	abstract = {Information about the patterns that govern the energy demand and onsite generation can generate significant savings in the range of 15–30\% in most cases and thus is essential for the management of commercial building energy systems. Predominantly, heating and cooling in a building as well as the availability of solar and wind energy are directly affected by variables such as temperature, humidity and solar radiation. This makes energy management decision making and planning sensitive to the prevalent and future weather conditions. Research attempts are being made using a variety of statistical or physical algorithms to predict the evolution of the building load or generation in order to optimise the building energy management. The response of the building energy system to changes in weather conditions is inherently challenging to predict; nevertheless numerous methods in the literature describe and utilise weather predictions. Such methods are being reviewed in this study and their strengths, weaknesses and applications in commercial buildings at different prediction horizons are discussed. Furthermore, the importance of considering weather forecasting inputs in energy management systems is established by highlighting the dependencies of various building components on weather conditions. The issues of the difficulty in implementation of integrated weather forecasts at commercial building level and the potential added value through energy management optimisation are also addressed. Finally, a novel framework is proposed that utilises a range of weather variable predictions in order to optimise certain commercial building systems.},

	abstract = {As the crucial foundation of distributed energy management systems, a reliable prediction of dynamic energy consumption is urgently needed in the building sector. Advances in metering technology and machine learning methods provide both opportunities and challenges. In particular, a clustering-based hybrid model is established in this paper to predict the day-ahead hourly electric demand in hotel buildings, which were initially classified as the non-stationary operated buildings ({NOB}) due to the irregular electric temporal features. Specifically, with multi-dimensional attributes of 100days considered by fuzzy c-means ({FCM}) clustering, similar days and hours were extracted stepwise into several homogeneous groups. Afterwards, the online modified predictor was established by the combination of support vector regression ({SVR}) and wavelet decomposition, taking the corresponding training samples extracted by {FCM} as the input. Clustered results of similar days testified the clear identification of stationary subsequences (Group {IV}) and non-stationary subsequences (Group I). Based on the validation, it can be concluded that the introduction of days-clustering can always improve the accuracy of day-ahead prediction, while the recognition of similar hours is necessary only for non-stationary subsequences. Finally, this paper offers an online short-term prediction approach for model-based energy management, based on the limited and fluctuating historical records.},
